# Hospital Data Management System 

This project is a Hospital Data Management System, developed as part of a Database Management Systems (DBMS) course. It uses SQL to manage the backend data and Streamlit to create a clean, user-friendly interface. The main goal of this system is to simplify and digitize hospital recordkeeping by providing a centralized platform for managing patient details, doctor information, appointments, and more.

Hospitals generate and rely on a large amount of information dailyâ€”patient records, appointment schedules, medical histories, doctor availability, and so on. Handling this manually or across scattered systems can lead to errors, delays, and inefficiency. This project addresses those challenges by building a system that brings everything into one place with structured data management and an intuitive interface.

The backend database, created using SQLite/MySQL, stores structured information in multiple interrelated tables. These include tables for patients, doctors, appointments, medical history, emergency contacts, and hospital staff. Relationships between the tables are maintained through primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity and avoid duplication.

On the frontend, Streamlit was used to design an interactive and easy-to-use web app. It allows users to input and view data through forms, search for patient or doctor records, schedule and cancel appointments, and update or delete entries in real-time. Streamlit made it easy to integrate SQL queries with a simple UI, without the need for complex frontend frameworks.

Key Features:

->  Add, view, update, and delete patient and doctor records

->  Appointment booking and cancellation system

->  Medical history tracking and emergency contact storage

->  Easy data retrieval and filtering using SQL queries

->  Real-time interaction through a responsive Streamlit web interface

The system also includes error handling to catch invalid inputs and confirmation messages to improve user experience. The simplicity of Streamlit made it ideal for rapid development and showcasing the backend functionality in a clear, visually appealing way.

Overall, this project provided valuable hands-on experience in database design, data manipulation using SQL, and building interactive apps using Python and Streamlit. It reflects how modern tools can be combined to create useful and scalable systems for real-world applications in healthcare.
